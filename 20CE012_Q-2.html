<pre>Understated Elegance…. Unquestionable Taste… Uncompromoising Quality…

Welcome to Sweet Cakes Beverly’s has been creating custom cakes and 
desserts long before it was the trendy thing to do. We started as a family 
bakeshop. Local customers fell in love. Word got out. Fast forward
two generations and our artistry and quality continue to set the trend. 
Our experience is admired though not easily replicated. Over the years 
our business has grown to include a talented team of professional bakers, 
decorators and customer service ambassadors. Even still, at the heart of 
it all we are a family bakery dedicated to bringing you sweet memories 
Thanks to our customers and local markets, we grew our brand to impact even 
more people. We created partnerships with local entrepreneurs and social 
enterprises and believe we all rise together when we work together. Our 
cookies have told stories about second chances and opportunities for young 
people. Our new products tell even more local stories. We have built a table 
big enough for us to share in the sweetness of life with friends, families 
and coworkers, so come see us!
